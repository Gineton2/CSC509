Course Level: Junior and senior undergraduates

Description: The interpretation of medical images is a major bottleneck in medicine. Traditionally, medical experts must train for years or decades to become proficient in distinguishing abnormalities such as lesions or cancerous growths from normal tissue. Nevertheless, expert radiologists often disagree in their interpretation of such images, resulting in delayed or erroneous diagnoses or uncertain measurements of disease progression. This course explores the application of state-of-the-art deep learning models to biomedical image analysis: the task of identifying objects such as features within an image and classifying images according to disease type. The course introduces key medical imaging technologies and data types, begins with an overview of topics central to medical image analysis and deep learning based image analysis and culminates in two hands-on case studies.

Course objectives:
1. Learn the fundamentals of biomedical imaging with focus on different imaging technologies and their applications in clinical practice and in clinical research. Students should be made cognizant of current challenges and some ways that machine learning can address them.

2. Learn how to apply machine learning tools to classify images and identify disease subtypes.
